        <h2>🔹 Introduction: The Problem with Game Achievement Tracking</h2>
        <p>If you're a completionist or trophy hunter, you probably use tools like Exophase, TrueAchievements, or PlayTracker to keep track of your progress.</p>
        <p>These platforms offer basic tracking, but they often:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>❌ Lack cross-platform syncing (PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam aren't unified).</li>
          <li>❌ Don't provide leaderboards or friend comparisons across platforms.</li>
          <li>❌ Miss social & competitive features that keep players engaged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's why we built PlatinumPath—a smarter, more engaging way to track ALL your gaming achievements in one place.</p>

        <h2>🔹 The Problems with Existing Achievement Trackers</h2>
        <p>We respect the work done by Exophase, PlayTracker, and TrueAchievements, but here's where they fall short:</p>
        <div className="overflow-x-auto">
          <table className="min-w-full">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Common Issues</th>
                <th>How PlatinumPath Fixes It</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>❌ No true cross-platform tracking</td>
                <td>✅ PlatinumPath syncs Xbox, PlayStation & Steam seamlessly</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>❌ No community features</td>
                <td>✅ Engage with other trophy hunters in leaderboards & discussions</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>❌ Limited game completion insights</td>
                <td>✅ Track your 100% completion rates & compare with friends</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>❌ No personalized achievement goals</td>
                <td>✅ Set tracking milestones & get notified on progress</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
